It's hard to change attitudes towards mental health without changing the whole culture.

A lot of tech culture in particular encourages long hours, overtime, crunch times, and other practices that promote overworking. While these business can be supportive on the surface of mental health, their practices are rarely beneficial for it.

More generally, outreach and open discussions can set examples for mental health discussions. Especially having management and team leads talking openly about their mental health can result in others feeling they have permission."
